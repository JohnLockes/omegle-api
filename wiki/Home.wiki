=Introduction=

Omegle, as most of you know is a stranger-to-stranger chatting service launched in 2009.

==Basics==
Omegle users can chat via the following ways:
  * Simple text,
  * Video (via a webcam),
  * "Spy mode" (explained later on),
and
  * via Facebook Connect (explained later).

==Structure==
The Omegle web interface is completely dynamic, and written using JavaScript. It uses the MooTools and SwfObject frameworks, as well as ReCaptcha for anti-spam. The main file we are going to be looking at is omegle.js.

=Lets begin=
==Introduction==
You may think the Omegle homepage (http://omegle.com) is the only site Omegle can be accessed with, but that's not the case. You see, there are actually *four* Omegle sites (excluding omegle.com). They are:
  * http://bajor.omegle.com
  * http://cardassia.omegle.com
  * http://promenade.omegle.com
and, recently,
  * http://odo-bucket.omegle.com

They are accessed via a frame on omegle's homepage, with the following comment:

 <!-- Yes, I'm using frames as a load balancing measure. Yes, I know
 this is horrible, insane, absurd, ridiculous, stupid, and
 broken. It's just a temporary stop-gap measure, though. -->

For security reasons, your app should choose a random server for each cat session.
